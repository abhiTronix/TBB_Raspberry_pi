# TBB ( Intel(R) Threading Building Blocks )
TBB is a library that helps you leverage multi-core processor performance without having to be a threading expert. It represents a higher-level, task-based parallelism that abstracts platform details and threading mechanism for performance and scalability.

# TBB for Raspberry Pi
A pre-compiled Latest binary (2018 - Update 4) of TBB for the Raspberry Pi built from scratch inorder to achieve max multi-threaded performance. It is available in a ".deb" package and will save your countless hours as not have to compile it yourself. There is no other Latest source of TBB file for raspberry pi available besides this on internet ;). This may or may not stay updated as I have to manually compile this version.  I will try to make available most major versions.  This was compiled on a **Raspberry Pi 2/3 Model B/B+ running raspbian Stretch**.  This enables TBB which helps multithreading in many OpenCV algorithms .

# Installation Instructions
## (Tested on Raspberry pi with Raspbian Stretch)
Simple (but straight forward):
```
sudo dpkg -i <path to libtbb-dev_2018-U4_armhf.deb>
sudo ldconfig
```
